                  For this awarded project, we created a personalized game to
                  the launch of SureCrisp from McCain, a global leader in the
                  frozen pre-fried potato industry, in partnership with Rappi,
                  since the product was developed to last longer crunchy, with a
                  focus on delivery.

                  and my role was to create the UI and develop the game based on

                  I started a concept of the game planning it to be played on
                  horizontal view (as you can see below). Initially it was a
                  suggestion from the lead agency.

                  After some tests and considerations it was clear it would't be
                  the best option because of the limited view of the scenery. It
                  would be harder to build a balanced game considering fun and
                  challenge to the users.

                  I decided for a view from top (the same as Sonic wings). Would
                  be harder to work in a "3D like" perspective with the deadline
                  we had and the top view provides a good visibility from the
                  scenary.
