                  To help Trinks in its goal of becoming the most used beauty
                  services app in Brazil, the portal and mobile app were rebuilt
                  from the ground with an experience totally dedicated to
                  scheduling services.

              <div className="text">
                <p>
                  The goal was to renew the entire app and website, in order to
                  make it more intuitive for the user, providing the best user
                  experience in the market. Trinks were running an MVP for
                  almost 2 years and many other players were getting into the
                  market.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Another concern was SEO. Getting better results on SERPs would
                  have a huge impact on achieving both B2B and B2C users.

              <h3>Process</h3>
              <div className="text">
                <p>
                  Beauty services were not something that I was very familiar to
                  (even my own hair I used to cut at home, but lack of previous
                  experience is never an excuse for a good design work ðŸ™‚).
                </p>
                <p>
                  I started by capturing information from all stakeholders. Many
                  (many) meetings with founders, team and users. It helped me
                  better understand the business and user cases.
                </p>
                <h4>Design principles</h4>
                <p>
                  After this initial immersion process I defined 4 principles to
                  guide the design project:
                </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Clear value proposition for B2B and B2C users.</li>
                  <li>
                    Aesthetics and minimalist design. (
                    <a
                      href="https://www.nngroup.com/"
                      rel="nofollow"
                      target="_blank"
                    >
                      Nielsen
                    </a>{" "}
                    would be proud)
                  </li>
                  <li>Provide simple experience for new users.</li>
                  <li>Provide appealing experience for recurrent users.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                  With these principles in hand and their MVP as a starting
                  point I started a 3 steps process to ideation:
                </p>
                <h4>1. Understanding user needs</h4>
                <p>
                  This is core to the process. Asking what users want is not
                  always enough. In this step I was aware of what triggered
                  behaviors.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One thing that came up in this process was that users are
                  often very loyal to their favorite beauty stores. With this
                  info I realized shortcuts (to book repeated services on the
                  favorite place is an example) would be very important to the
                  UX. Other ideas came up in the same process as well.

                <h4>2. Finding deficiencies in the current product</h4>
                <p>
                  Comparing findings on step one to the current product,
                  heuristics and benchmarking were key to define what we should
                  build.

                  Finally solutions. Several ideas came up in the process. I
                  prototyped some of them and the most valuable ones (validated
                  with stakeholders) were introduced in the final experience.
